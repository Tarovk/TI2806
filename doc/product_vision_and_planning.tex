\section{Introduction}
Last couple of years, services for version control and continuous integration of software, like GitHub, have become popular tools to make software development easier. For both public and private projects, contributors suggest a major change by creating a pull request. These changes are then reviewed by the responsible project members or other contributors.

The goal of the Tools for Software Engineering Context Project (TSE) is to collect, analyse and present information about the code review process: what do code reviewers do when inspecting a pull request? What can we learn from this?
