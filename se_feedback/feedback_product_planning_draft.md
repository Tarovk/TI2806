###High-level Product Backlog
* The useful data needs to be visualised for the user.
	* What is useful data, please provide concrete definitions
* MoSCoW??

###Roadmap
* You need to provide more details, when do plan on having major features finished, when do plan on integrating with other teams, etc
* Simply referring to the high-level product backlog and saying it will be finished by the end of the project isn't enough

##Product Backlog
* User stories of knowÂ­how acquisition
	* How will your user learn how to use Octopeer
	
* Will the product crash silently or alert the user that something went wrong, assume your system isn't perfect

##Definition of Done
* Update the architecture design document when you complete an implementation task, saves time and effort
* Documents? Spell-checked, grammar checked, structurely completed, peer reviewed, etc

##Glossary
* Either fill it in with useful terms or remove this section
