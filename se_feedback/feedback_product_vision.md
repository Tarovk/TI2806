## General

* I think the rule for referencing is as follows. If there are three or more authors, you use the first author and append et al.

## Introduction

* I find it a bit odd to find an introducing section in the introduction - quite unusual.
* I would not put the pull-based software development model and formal code inspections in the same boat. No big deal though.

## Target Audience

-

## Customer Needs

-

## Crucial Product Attributes

* The high-level product backlog has some overlapping items. More effort should have been spent on this part.

## Comparison to Existing Products

* It would nice to discuss what the tool does that Microsoft has patented because it also deals with code reviews.

## Project Timespan
