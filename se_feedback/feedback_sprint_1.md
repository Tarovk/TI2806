## Notes
* Specify the User stories more, need to be more clearly defined
* A-E defined prioritisation only A-C is used (usually means you didn't include enough tasks or wrong granularity)
* Why was Problem 1/2, a problem. For future sprints add motivation as to how the problem affected the workflow.
* Motivation why you changed from hours to points to estimate tasks is missing (it's a choice, it's not manditory so explain why)
* Please add a table with the total number of hours per person
