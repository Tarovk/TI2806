## Notes
* Better definition of user stories
* A-E defined prioritisation only A-C is used (usually means you didn't include enough tasks or wrong granularity)
* Why was Problem 1 a problem. To put it differently, why is the lack of engineers to interview an obstacle?
* Also make sure rows are not cutoff in pdf view
* Thanks for adding the table!
