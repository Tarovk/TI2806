##Notes
* Good start on the ADD
* Some comments detailing what each file is would be nice
* If possible, I would highly recommend separating style (css), structure (html), and functionality (js); right now they are mixed
* Add Travis to your repo homepage
* Thumbs up is a decent way to show that you read the pull-request, would like to see some more activity. I'm not present during the offline meetings and don't have access to the comments on Google Drive (or whatever you use to write docs).
