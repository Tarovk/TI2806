The Sprint Plan will be graded when you turn in the retorspective this Friday (April 29).

* My advice would be to estimate tasks in pts and not hours
* What about the product vision and product planning drafts?
* Also you may want to start with the Architecture Design Document
* Tasks look evenly split though an overview of how much work each member has been allocated would be nice. Getting frameworks to work is assigned to 2 people and is worth 5 hours of work; is that 5 hours total or per person
