##Notes
* With a lot of focus on the docs, the scores are lower for this Sprint. Looking forward to the new progress and hope to be giving higher grades.
* Do you have tools for line coverage? If so (and when you have tests) upload these reports to GitHub by
	* Adding it at the end of the Sprint
	* Setting up Travis so it updates the report on the repo on every run
* Thanks for adding Travis to your repo homepage
* Thumbs up is a decent way to show that you read the pull-request, would like to see some more activity. I'm not present during the offline meetings and don't have access to the comments on Google Drive (or whatever you use to write docs).
