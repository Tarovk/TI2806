## Notes
* Clear point system
* To me it seems you are missing the real data to the extent that it's hard to continue forward without it
* GH-Torrent and associated topics should be in the problems.
* Poor reflection. In meetings you explain more; you take the time to motivate decesions and explain problems. Here write it and explain it in that way. You have to document things like the dummy data starting to be a bottle-neck.
