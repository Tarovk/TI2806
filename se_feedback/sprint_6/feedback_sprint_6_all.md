## Notes
* Thanks for adding the overview of what was and what wasn't finished
* Reflection is missing why "Write documentation for the tests" wasn't finished
* 8 points for writing documentation?
	* Hard to tell how many hours this is worth, but what sort of documentation were you planning on writing?
* 20 point tasks usually should be split into smaller tasks
