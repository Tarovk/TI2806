* Add notes (and/or problems) to explain what happened

##Notes
* Good that you increased the test coverage!
* Keep up the peer reviews!
* `graph1.js` + `graph2.js` are not a proper names
* Thanks for renaming `time.js`!
* `SvgCreator` + services (everything in `main.js`) + `Settings` seems like a good candidate for a Singleton but isn't
* `cache.js` - use cache not cash in naming and comments
